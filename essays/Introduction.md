Hi. My name is Clement Li and I am a student of ITM 352. There were a number of factors that contributed to my decision to major in MIS. The chief motivation was from my prior STEM experiences during middle and high school. I developed a keen interest in technology and programming thanks to those experiences.  I also took a class with Professor Eduard Merc and the material he lectured on was interesting enough to embark on adding MIS as a second major.

Additionally, I am intrigued with the opportunities this major can allow me to experience in a world that has seen large technological advancements in last century. I hope to have a hand in creating the next innovations and help technology companies continue to grow. MIS is becoming important in the technological field- and having people around who can translate a business need into a technical solution is an additional benefit.

It also does not hurt that I had fulfilled some course requirements for the MIS major accidently during my earlier semester. So it is quite convenient for me to double major in this field. I hope to improve my skills in MIS through this class in this coming semester.
